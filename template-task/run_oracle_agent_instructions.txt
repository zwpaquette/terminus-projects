Oracle Agent
The Oracle Agent runs your solution/solve.sh in the task environment and verifies it passes all tests. It's the first line of validation for your task.

What is the Oracle Agent?
The Oracle Agent is an automated agent that:

Starts your Docker environment
Executes your solution/solve.sh commands
Runs your tests to verify completion
Reports pass/fail results
If the Oracle Agent can't complete your task, neither can AI agents.

Key Concept: The Oracle Agent verifies that your task is solvable. If the Oracle can't solve your task, it's broken.

Running the Oracle Agent
bash

Copy
# Basic run
harbor run --agent oracle --path <task-folder>

# With verbose output
harbor run --agent oracle --path <task-folder> -v
Expected Output
Successful Run

Copy
Starting task: my-task
Building Docker environment...
Running oracle solution...
  ✓ Step 1 completed
  ✓ Step 2 completed
  ✓ Step 3 completed
Running tests...
  ✓ test_output_exists PASSED
  ✓ test_format_correct PASSED
  ✓ test_values_valid PASSED

RESULT: PASS
Failed Run

Copy
Starting task: my-task
Building Docker environment...
Running oracle solution...
  ✓ Step 1 completed
  ✗ Step 2 failed: command not found

RESULT: FAIL
Error: Solution did not complete successfully
Debugging Failures
Debugging Workflow
When the Oracle Agent fails, follow this workflow:

Step 1: Identify the Failure

Read the error message carefully
Which step failed?
What was the error?
What file/command was involved?
Step 2: Reproduce Interactively

bash

Copy
harbor tasks start-env --path <task-folder> --interactive
Inside the container, run commands one by one to find the issue.

Step 3: Fix and Re-test

Update solution/solve.sh or environment/Dockerfile
Run Oracle again
Repeat until passing
Solution Fails
If your solution doesn't run:

Enter interactive mode:

bash

Copy
harbor tasks start-env --path <task-folder> --interactive
Run commands manually to find the failing step

Check for:

Typos in commands
Missing dependencies
Wrong file paths
Permission issues
Tests Fail
If the solution runs but tests fail:

Check test output for specific failures

Verify your solution actually produces expected output

Check for:

Incorrect output format
Missing files
Off-by-one errors
Edge cases not handled
Environment Issues
If the container won't build:

Check Dockerfile syntax in environment/Dockerfile

Verify base image exists and is accessible

Check dependency installation commands

Try building manually:

bash

Copy
cd <task-folder>/environment
docker build -t test .
Common Issues
"command not found"	Missing dependency	Add to environment/Dockerfile
"file not found"	Wrong path	Use absolute paths
"permission denied"	File permissions	Check chmod in environment/Dockerfile
Tests timeout	Solution too slow	Optimize or increase timeout
Common Debugging Scenarios
Missing File:


Copy
Error: No such file: /app/data/input.csv
Fix: Check environment/Dockerfile COPY commands and file paths

Command Not Found:


Copy
Error: grep: command not found
Fix: Add package to environment/Dockerfile apt-get install

Test Assertion Failed:


Copy
AssertionError: Expected 42, got 41
Fix: Debug your solution logic

Timeout:


Copy
Error: Task exceeded timeout (1800s)
Fix: Optimize solution or increase timeout in task.toml ([agent].timeout_sec)

Oracle vs Real Agents
Runs your solution/solve.sh	Generate their own solution
Always deterministic	May vary between runs
Tests task validity	Tests task difficulty
Must always pass	May fail (that's the goal!)
Best Practices
Run oracle early and often — Don't wait until submission

Fix oracle failures first — If oracle fails, task is broken

Check all test output — Understand why tests pass/fail

Keep environment minimal — Easier to debug

Practice Exercise
Using the practice notebook:

Load the sample task
Run the Oracle (it will fail)
Identify the issue
Fix the solution
Run Oracle again until passing
