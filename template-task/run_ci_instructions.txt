What You'll Learn
Understanding CI check output
Interpreting LLMaJ feedback
Iterating on failures efficiently
Common patterns and fixes
CI Iteration Workflow

Copy
Run checks → Identify failures → Fix issues → Re-run → Repeat
Step 1: Run All Checks
bash

Copy
harbor tasks check <task-folder> --model openai/@openai-tbench/gpt-5
Step 2: Review Output

Copy
CI Checks:
  ✓ pinned_dependencies
  ✗ check_task_absolute_path
  ✓ validate_task_fields

LLMaJ Checks:
  ✓ behavior_in_tests
  ✗ informative_test_docstrings
  ✓ anti_cheating_measures

2 checks failed
Step 3: Fix One Issue at a Time
Focus on one failure at a time. The error message will tell you exactly what's wrong:


Copy
✗ check_task_absolute_path
  Line 3: "Edit config/settings.json"
  Use absolute path: /app/config/settings.json
For detailed fix instructions: See CI Checks Reference and LLMaJ Checks Reference

Step 4: Re-run and Verify
bash

Copy
harbor tasks check <task-folder> --model openai/@openai-tbench/gpt-5
Step 5: Repeat
Continue fixing issues one at a time until all checks pass.

Understanding Error Messages
Error messages are designed to be helpful. They typically include:

Which check failed (e.g., check_task_absolute_path)
Where the issue is (file and line number)
What's wrong (specific problem description)
How to fix it (suggestion or requirement)
Read the error message carefully—it tells you exactly what needs to be fixed.

Tips for Efficient Iteration
Fix easy issues first — Start with CI checks (syntax/structure) before LLMaJ (quality)

Run locally before submitting — Saves time and helps you catch issues early

Read error messages carefully — They tell you exactly what's wrong and often how to fix it

One fix at a time — Easier to track what worked and debug if something breaks

Use the reference guides — CI Checks Reference and LLMaJ Checks Reference have detailed explanations for each check

Checklist Before Final Submission
 All CI checks pass
 All LLMaJ checks pass
 Oracle agent passes
 Real agents tested (difficulty verified)
 Code reviewed for quality
